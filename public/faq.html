            <h3>What payment methods do you accept?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Pay Pal is the method of payment we accept for those purchasing E-Design services.

            <h3>Do you offer refunds?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer">
              Because of the nature of the product being a pdf file via email, there are no refunds. Depending on which package you choose
              you may have a few days to request a vision board change and time during the design phase to tweak some of
              the design elements.
